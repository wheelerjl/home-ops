# My Home Gitops Infrastructure

## Overview

WIP home infrastructure using Talos as the OS to install kubernetes and flux to manage it

I've used 2 sources for the development of this repo...

The first is istalling Talos loosely using this guide:
https://kubito.dev/posts/talos-linux-raspberry-pi/

The second is the kubernetes portion with flux taken from a wide range of public repos from the k8s-at-home community. Primarily based on the [flux-cluster-template](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/flux-cluster-template) but also from various other community members as needed to fit my infrastructure choices.
